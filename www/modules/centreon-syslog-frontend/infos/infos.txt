Syslog Module for Centreon 2.1.x

Customize your options in 'Administration -> Modules -> Syslog -> Configuration' menu.

If this is the first installation, please put "logs" in "Syslog Table Name" field for first day.
The second day, you can put "all_logs" in "Syslog Table Name" field beause this table was created
after first tables rotation.
