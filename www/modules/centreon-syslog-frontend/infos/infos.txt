Customize your options in 'Configuration -> Syslog -> General -> Refresh' menu.

Add new Centreon syslog collector server using 'Configuration -> Syslog -> Collectors -> Add' menu.

If this is the first installation, please set "logs" in "Syslog Table Name" field for first day.
The second day, you can set "all_logs" in "Syslog Table Name" field beause this table was created after first tables rotation.
